# PixieClean Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** April 28, 2025

PixieClean (“we”, “us” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains:

## 1. Information We Collect  
- **On-Device Analysis Only**: All photo processing, hashing, and ML‐based similarity detection happens entirely on your device—no images, thumbnails, or metadata ever leave your phone.
- **Optional Analytics**: With your permission, we collect only anonymized usage metrics (total analyses run, storage reclaimed). No personally identifiable information (PII) is ever sent to our servers.

## 2. How We Use Data  
- To power duplicate detection and quality ranking in-app.  
- To show you your usage stats (all stored locally in `UserDefaults`).

## 3. Data Storage & Security  
- All data stays on your device. We do *not* share or store your photos or metadata on any server.  
- Communications to update the app or fetch new ML models are encrypted via HTTPS.

## 4. Your Choices  
- You can opt out of analytics in Settings → Privacy.  
- Deleting the app removes *all* related data.

## 5. Contact Us  
If you have any questions, please email us at privacy@pixieclean.app.
